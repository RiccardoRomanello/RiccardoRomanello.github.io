								<h1>Currently ongoing</h1>
								<p>Here you will find what I am currtenly working on. All the topics 
									you will find in this paged are linked by one key concept: Graphs in Quantum Computing. 
									If you think, for example,  about Automata or Random Walks or Machine Learning in the classical setting, 
									they can all be described as Graphs (and a lot of other problems can be added to the list). 
									Such characterization led, in the decades, to a lot of very powerful results obtained using only graph theory 
									applied to a variety of different disciplines. 
									In the Quantum case, there is still some kind of gap. Encoding (Directed) Graphs to 
									obtain a Quantum Circuit is not a trivial task, Quantum (one way) Finite Automata 
									are not as expressive as their classical counterpart and Quantum Neural Networks are still
									very young. 
									For this reason the question I am trying to answer is the following: are Graphs as powerful as in the classical case, 
									for the Quantum setting too?

									<h2>Graphs Encoding in Quantum Computing</h2>
								</header>
								<p> My very first paper as a PhD student was about Graphs encoding in Quantum Computing. 
									It seems to be not a so trivial task because of the unitarity requirement of Quantum Computing. 
									In my github you can also find a python project (<a href="https://github.com/RiccardoRomanello/FREEQO" target="_new">FREEQO</a>) in which we implemented an encoder that given a directed Graph, 
									computes an unitary matrix that can be used as a circuit to traverse such graph.

									<h2>Quantum Finite Automata</h2>
								</header>
								<p> I am working on the topics I introduced in my master thesis in order to publish a new 
									paper. 
									The aim of this research is to design a class of automata able to overcome the limitations of
									state of the art Quantum Automata.  </p>

									<h2>Quantum Machine Learning</h2>
								</header>
								<p> I got interested in this topic while practicing some demo using PennyLane. 
									I am studying both theoretical aspects and practical approaches.
									For what concerns the theoretical results,  I am interested in how the fundamental theorems in the classic case can be
									translated into the quantum setting (like no free lunch theorem, or PAC learnability and so on). 
									Moreover, being a computer scientist, I am interested in the complexity analysis of QML techniques. 
									On the practical point of view, I always excercise using pennylane and their demos.

									<h2>Neural Network Compression</h2>
								</header>
								<p>Always concerning graphs, during the past months, we tackled the Neural Network Reduction 
								problem (i.e. removing 'useless' neurons) using a theoretical approach. In particular, 
								we borrowed the notion of Lumpability from graph theory and devised
								a polinomial time procedure that can reduce the size of NNs without reducing their accuracy. </p>

									<h2>Quantum Circuit Synthesis</h2>
								</header>
								<p> Once a Quantum Algorithm has been devised, we would be really happy if we could execute it. 
									This seems a stupid assumptions, but it is not. In the Quantum Circuit architecture, the problem 
									of turning a generic quantum algorithm (a really huge unitary matrix) into a sequence of smaller and executable 
									operations (smaller gates/unitaries), is not easy at all. 
									Such problem is called Quantum Circuit Synthesis and it is a really fervent research area nowadays.
									Up to now, I have been working on the synthesis of circuits using the Clifford+T basis.
